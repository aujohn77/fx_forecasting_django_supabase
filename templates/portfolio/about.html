  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p><strong>João Eduardo Reis (John)</strong></p>

 <p>
  I'm an early-career data science learner with a PhD in Mathematics and a strong
  interest in machine learning, forecasting, and practical problem-solving. I'm
  currently studying Database Management in Australia as part of my transition
  into the data/ML field.
</p>

<p>
I'm building real projects as I learn. This portfolio includes my MIT IDSS capstone projects 
and an independently designed ML deployment platform for FX forecasting, built from a 
genuine interest in applying what I learn to real-world problems.</p>
