  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p><strong>João Eduardo Reis (John)</strong></p>

 <p>
  I'm an early-career data science learner with a PhD in Mathematics and a strong
  interest in machine learning, forecasting, and practical problem-solving. I'm
  currently studying Database Management in Australia as part of my transition
  into the data/ML field.
</p>

<p>
  I'm building real projects as I learn. This portfolio includes coursework projects
  and a personal FX forecasting system where I applied Python, Django, R, and
  Supabase to create an end-to-end solution.
